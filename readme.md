## Trail Status

[TrailStatus.io](http://trailstatus.io) is an easy way to keep up-to-date with trail closings.  You will no longer head
to the trail only to find they closed it due to muddy conditions.  Check back regularly as I plan to add more trails.  Feedback
on what trails should be added next would be appreciated!

Share with your friends and anyone you think would be interested!

## Why?
I started this project so I wouldn't have to remember to call into the John Muir Trail line. 

## Integrations
No *official* integrations exist yet but I am curating JSON and XML here:

- http://trailstatus.io/john-muir/json
- http://trailstatus.io/john-muir/xml

I connected [If this then that](http://ifttt.com) to monitor the XML feed for changes then shoot me a text message when there is a change.  Here is
the IFTTT recipe: https://ifttt.com/recipes/305632-john-muir-trail-updates-via-text
